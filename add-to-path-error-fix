WARNING: The script django-admin is installed in '/Users/rana/Library/Python/2.7/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.}

# what happened is that django was installed in the path /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python
where The script django-admin was installed in '/Users/rana/Library/Python/2.7/bin

# When you open a terminal session the PATH is the system PATH with is where the django was installed, thus it couldn't find django-admin. To fix this we have to add the location of django-admin to the $PATH and load it in our terminal session.

# To test if this is working first try loading the $ to your terminal session. Then run a django-admin command (i.g create a project)
$ PATH=$PATH:/Users/rana/Library/Python/2.7/bin
$ django-admin startproject waetherApp
# if those changes work, go ahead and add this new PATH to your shell profile (in my case it's bash so add to .bash_profile) so it's loaded to every terminal session.
$ open ~/.bash_profile
#in the text editor add those lines
PATH=$PATH:/Users/rana/Library/Python/2.7/bin
export PATH

VOLA!
